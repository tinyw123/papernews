![papernews on a reMarkable, next to a cup of coffee](assets/hero.jpg)

Every news site looks different. Hacker News, MacRumors, Quanta, my
favourite ML blog, my favourite math blog — each one its own layout, fonts,
colors, ads. To read anything I had to wade through somebody's design
choices first and focus past the visual noise.

I much prefer reading the way a LaTeX paper or an old magazine looks: quiet
typography, generous margins, no color, nothing competing for attention.

**papernews** is the fix. A script pulls all those feeds, has Claude clean
up, translate to English, and rewrite the article bodies — the **full
text**, not just summaries — and renders the result into one consistently
typeset LaTeX PDF. Every article is *in* the PDF; you read entirely
offline, no clicking through, no opening tabs.

A side benefit I didn't expect to like but very much do: one place to read
the day's news instead of five tabs being refreshed all day. One or two
issues per day, no more.

Designed for an e-ink reader like the reMarkable, but it works just as well
in any browser's PDF viewer.

## Status

Hobby project; works. Things will move. Expect rough edges.

## How to use

You need: a machine that can run Docker (your laptop, a NAS, a $5/mo VPS,
anything), an LLM backend (Anthropic API key, a free
[Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys) API key, **or** a local
[Ollama](https://ollama.com) instance), and ~2 GB of disk for the image.

```bash
# 1) Pull
git clone https://github.com/tinyw123/papernews
cd papernews

# 2) Configure
cp .env.example .env
$EDITOR .env             # paste ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
                          # (or set LLM_BACKEND=groq + GROQ_API_KEY=gsk-...,
                          # or LLM_BACKEND=ollama)

# 3) Pick your sources
$EDITOR sources.toml     # add/remove RSS/HN entries, set per-source limits

# 4) (Optional) Tweak the look
$EDITOR papernews/template.tex.j2

# 5) Build + run
docker compose up --build -d

# Open http://localhost:8000
# First PDF builds on demand and is cached. Background ingest runs every 4h.
```

Everything you'd normally want to change is in **two files**:

- **`sources.toml`** — which feeds, how many items per feed, in what order.
  Two source kinds today: `kind = "hn"` (Hacker News, top-by-points via the
  Algolia API) and `kind = "rss"` (any Atom/RSS feed via feedparser).
- **`papernews/template.tex.j2`** — the LaTeX template. Page size, fonts,
  colors, layout, what goes on the cover, everything. Edit, restart the
  container, refresh `/digest.pdf`.

Optional but useful:

- **`papernews/summarize.py`** + **`papernews/rewrite.py`** — the LLM
  system prompts. When using Anthropic, change `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` to
  `claude-sonnet-4-6` for fancier rewrites at ~10× the cost; when using
  Groq, change `GROQ_MODEL` (see [Groq](#groq-free-tier) below); adjust
  `_SYSTEM` to change the editorial voice (e.g. disable the
  auto-translate-to-English rule).
- **`papernews/wiki.py`** — what goes into the World news block and the
  Quote-of-the-day source.

### Getting the PDF onto a reMarkable

A few different ways, no special script needed:

- **Manual** — open `http://your-machine:8000/digest.pdf` in a browser on
  your phone/laptop and upload it to your reMarkable from there (drag-and-
  drop on `my.remarkable.com`, or the reMarkable mobile app, or the USB Web
  Interface at `http://10.11.99.1` while connected by USB).
- **[`rmapi`](https://github.com/ddvk/rmapi)** — a third-party CLI that
  pushes files to your reMarkable cloud account. Pair once, then:
  ```bash
  curl -s http://your-machine:8000/digest.pdf -o today.pdf
  rmapi put today.pdf /Papernews
  ```
  Stick that two-liner in cron on the host and the device picks it up on
  next sync automatically.
- **[Remailable](https://github.com/remailable/remailable)** — a third-party
  email-to-reMarkable bridge ([remailable.getneutrality.org](https://remailable.getneutrality.org)).
  You email the PDF as an attachment to your assigned address and it appears
  on the device. Useful if your papernews host can `mail`/`mutt` but can't
  reach the reMarkable directly. (reMarkable has no first-party
  email-to-device; do not believe earlier versions of this README that
  implied otherwise.)

No native push is built-in because everyone's setup is different and you
probably don't want me poking your reMarkable cloud account with your token.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tinyw123/papernews
cd papernews
cp .env.example .env
# paste your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY into .env (get one at
# https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys), or set
# LLM_BACKEND=groq + GROQ_API_KEY (free, see LLM backends below)
docker compose up --build
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` — landing page with a preview image and a
link to `/digest.pdf`. The first PDF builds on demand, takes ~1–2 minutes the
first time and is then cached until new content arrives.

State lives in `./data/state.db` (bind-mounted from the host) so it survives
container restarts.

## LLM backends

papernews routes all LLM calls through `papernews/llm.py`. Switch backends
with the `LLM_BACKEND` env var.

### Anthropic (default)

```bash
# .env
LLM_BACKEND=anthropic
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

Uses `claude-haiku-4-5` by default. Override with `ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-6`
for higher quality at ~10× the cost.

### Groq (free tier)

Hosted inference, OpenAI-compatible API, no GPU needed. Groq's free tier is
generous enough for a daily digest of a few dozen articles.

```bash
# .env
LLM_BACKEND=groq
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...                       # create at https://console.groq.com/keys
GROQ_MODEL=openai/gpt-oss-120b             # default; see below
PAPERNEWS_WORKERS=2                        # lower than the Anthropic default (8) —
                                            # the free tier's requests-per-minute
                                            # limit is easy to hit with 8 concurrent
                                            # batched calls
```

**On the model.** Groq deprecates and swaps out hosted models more often
than Anthropic — `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`, an earlier default for many
projects, was retired in August 2026. Check
[console.groq.com/docs/models](https://console.groq.com/docs/models) (or
`curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $GROQ_API_KEY"
https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/models`) for what's currently live before
relying on the default above. `qwen/qwen3.6-27b` is a smaller, faster
alternative that leaves more free-tier rate-limit headroom if
`openai/gpt-oss-120b` feels tight.

### Ollama (local)

Run any model locally — no API key, no per-token cost, nothing leaves your
machine.

```bash
# .env
LLM_BACKEND=ollama
OLLAMA_HOST=http://your-ollama-host:11434   # default: http://localhost:11434
OLLAMA_MODEL=qwen2.5:3b                    # default: mistral
OLLAMA_TIMEOUT=1800                        # seconds; increase for slow hardware
PAPERNEWS_WORKERS=1                        # set to 1 for CPU inference
```

**Model recommendations:** The rewrite step is token-heavy — aim for a model
that balances speed and quality for your hardware.

| Model | VRAM | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `qwen2.5:3b` | ~2 GB | Fast, fits on most GPUs |
| `mistral:7b` | ~5 GB | Better quality, needs a discrete GPU |
| `qwen2.5:7b` | ~5 GB | Good quality/speed balance |

CPU inference works but is slow. A discrete GPU with ROCm (AMD) or CUDA
(NVIDIA) support makes a significant difference. Set `PAPERNEWS_WORKERS=1`
when running on CPU to avoid hammering Ollama with concurrent requests.

## What it produces

A 100–200 page PDF with:

- **Cover page**: title + date + article count, quote of the day from
  Wikiquote, a "World news" block (5 tech headlines + 2 Western items from
  Wikipedia's Current Events portal, each compressed to a single sentence).
- **Contents**: every article grouped by source, with dot-leaders to its
  publication date.
- **"Did you know…"** trivia nuggets from Wikipedia's Main Page.
- **The articles themselves**, set in two-column Latin Modern with proper
  paragraph indents, hyphenation, microtypography. Math (`$x = y$`,
  `$$\int f$$`, `\(...\)`, `\[...\]`) is rendered as real LaTeX math. Code
  blocks (fenced or inline) come through in monospace.
- All non-English source content (heise, etc.) is translated to English
  during the rewrite step. You can disable that in the prompt if you don't
  want it.

Four stages, each idempotent and resumable:

1. **gather** — pulls new items from each source, runs `trafilatura` to
   extract the article body, stores the raw text. Pure I/O — no LLM cost.
2. **summarize** — batches up to 8 articles per LLM call and produces a
   ≤40-word two-sentence summary for each (used as the lede in the front
   matter and in the contents listing).
3. **rewrite** — batches up to 8 articles per LLM call and produces a
   clean, properly-paragraphed, translated-to-English version of each
   article body for the renderer. Preserves code fences and `$math$` exactly.
4. **render** — pulls the latest N articles per source from the store,
   plus fresh world news + quote + DYK, and runs them through a Jinja
   template into xelatex → PDF. Results are cached by a hash of "what's in
   the store" + "what's in sources.toml". Same content + same config → same
   cached PDF served instantly.

A background `APScheduler` job runs steps 1–3 every 4 hours (configurable).
The render step is on-demand; the first hit to `/digest.pdf` after an ingest
builds the PDF and caches it.

## HTTP endpoints

| route          | what it does                                            |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `GET /`        | minimal landing page, cover preview + Read PDF link     |
| `GET /digest.pdf` | the current edition (built on demand, then cached)   |
| `GET /preview.png` | page 1 rasterized at 180 DPI                        |
| `GET /sources` | JSON list of configured sources + latest `fetched_at`   |
| `GET /healthz` | liveness probe (returns `ok`)                           |
| `POST /ingest` | manual kick of the gather → summarize → rewrite cycle   |

## Configuring sources

Sources live in [`sources.toml`](sources.toml) — that's the exact file used
to produce [the sample PDF](sample-2026-06-04.pdf). Open it, copy a block,
edit, restart the container, refresh `/digest.pdf`.

The order of `[[source]]` blocks in the file is the order they'll appear in
the PDF — sources at the top come first. World news, quote of the day, and
the "Did you know…" nuggets are not configured here — they're cover
decorations, fetched fresh on every render.

### `kind = "hn"` — Hacker News via the Algolia search API

Ranks stories by points within a time window. No URL needed; the API is
hardcoded.

| field          | type | default | meaning |
|----------------|------|---------|---------|
| `name`         | string | required | display label (also the contents-page heading) |
| `kind`         | string | required | must be `"hn"` |
| `limit`        | int  | `10`     | how many top stories to keep |
| `since_hours`  | int  | `48`     | only consider stories submitted in the last N hours |
| `min_points`   | int  | `50`     | story must have at least this many points to qualify |

```toml
[[source]]
name        = "Hacker News"
kind        = "hn"
limit       = 10
since_hours = 48
min_points  = 100
```

### `kind = "rss"` — any Atom/RSS feed

Parsed with [feedparser](https://feedparser.readthedocs.io/), so it accepts
RSS 0.9/1.0/2.0 and Atom 1.0 — every blog and most news sites work.

| field         | type   | default  | meaning |
|---------------|--------|----------|---------|
| `name`        | string | required | display label (also the contents-page heading) |
| `kind`        | string | required | must be `"rss"` |
| `url`         | string | required | feed URL |
| `limit`       | int    | `20`     | take at most N most-recent items |
| `since_hours` | int    | unset    | skip articles published more than N hours ago (uses the feed's `published`/`updated` date; articles with no date are always kept) |

```toml
[[source]]
name        = "Quanta Magazine"
kind        = "rss"
url         = "https://www.quantamagazine.org/feed/"
limit       = 8
since_hours = 168   # one week
```

### Per-source ordering and limits in practice

The `limit` is applied **twice**, on purpose:

- At **fetch** time: gather doesn't pull more than `limit` items from the
  feed (saves bandwidth and trafilatura time).
- At **render** time: even if the store accumulates more than `limit` items
  for a source across multiple ingests (it will — items don't get deleted),
  only the latest `limit` per source make it into a given PDF.

So if you want Quanta to have at most 8 articles in the issue, regardless of
how many they've published this week → set `limit = 8`. If you want Hacker
News to show only the top 5 by points in the last 24h → set `limit = 5,
since_hours = 24`.

> **On the totals.** Adding up every `limit` in `sources.toml` gives you the
> maximum article count per issue. Aim for **30–60 articles** for a
> comfortable 30–60 minute read. Claude's summaries are dense; volume isn't
> quality. An empty section on a slow day is cleaner than padding.

## Scheduling ingests

Two modes; pick whichever fits your routine. Set the env var in `.env`.

### Every N hours (default)

```bash
# .env
INGEST_INTERVAL_SECONDS=14400   # 4 hours (the default)
```

### Cron-style fixed times — "morning and evening edition"

```bash
# .env
INGEST_SCHEDULE=07:00,18:00     # comma-separated HH:MM
INGEST_TIMEZONE=Europe/London   # any IANA tz; default UTC
```

If both are set, `INGEST_SCHEDULE` wins. The render is still on-demand —
hitting `/digest.pdf` between scheduled runs gives you the cached PDF
instantly.

You can also kick a manual ingest any time:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ingest
```

## Delivery — push the PDF wherever you want

A built-in hook fires after every successful ingest. Point
`POST_INGEST_HOOK` at any executable on the container's filesystem (drop
the script into your `./data/hooks/` directory so it survives rebuilds via
the bind mount). The hook receives the freshly-built PDF path as its first
argument.

```bash
# .env
POST_INGEST_HOOK=/data/hooks/push-to-remarkable.sh
POST_INGEST_HOOK_TIMEOUT=300    # optional; default 300s
```

Hook failures are non-fatal — a broken hook logs an error but doesn't
crash the ingest loop.

### Sample: push to a reMarkable 2 over WiFi

Drop this in `./data/hooks/push-to-remarkable.sh` and `chmod +x` it:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Push the latest issue to a reMarkable 2 via SSH.
# Usage: push-to-remarkable.sh <pdf-path>
set -euo pipefail

PDF="$1"
REMARKABLE="root@10.11.99.1"            # adjust to your device's IP
SSH_KEY=/data/hooks/remarkable_id_ed25519

scp -i "$SSH_KEY" -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new \
    "$PDF" "$REMARKABLE:/home/root/papernews.pdf"

# Refresh the UI so the file appears immediately.
ssh -i "$SSH_KEY" "$REMARKABLE" 'systemctl restart xochitl'
```

Generate a passwordless key (`ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f
data/hooks/remarkable_id_ed25519 -N ""`), add the `.pub` to the
reMarkable's `/home/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` once, and from then on
every ingest pushes the new paper to your device.

The same pattern works for Kindle (`scp` over USB networking), a network
printer (`lp -d papernews "$PDF"`), an email (`mutt -a "$PDF"`), or
anything else you can script.

## Tests

Modest, no-network unittest suite for the web/scheduling/hook behaviour:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

## Local development

You don't have to use Docker — the CLI works directly:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e .
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...   # or: export LLM_BACKEND=groq GROQ_API_KEY=gsk-...
                                       # or: export LLM_BACKEND=ollama OLLAMA_HOST=...

.venv/bin/python -m papernews gather       # fetch + extract
.venv/bin/python -m papernews summarize    # LLM pass 1 (batched)
.venv/bin/python -m papernews rewrite      # LLM pass 2 (batched)
.venv/bin/python -m papernews render       # xelatex → PDF
# or all of the above in sequence:
.venv/bin/python -m papernews build
```

Requirements: Python 3.11+, `xelatex` (TeX Live with `texlive-xetex`,
`texlive-latex-extra`, `lmodern`), `pdftoppm` (poppler).

## Customizing the typography

Everything visual lives in one file: [`papernews/template.tex.j2`](papernews/template.tex.j2).

- Page size: `paperwidth=157mm, paperheight=210mm` (tuned for reMarkable Pro)
- Body font: Latin Modern Roman 10pt
- Two-column body for any article over 2000 characters; single-column
  otherwise
- First-line paragraph indent instead of vertical `\parskip` (classic
  magazine convention)
- Microtype protrusion + expansion
- Letter-spacing on small-caps source labels via fontspec's `LetterSpace`

Customize whatever you like — the Jinja delimiters are LaTeX-safe
(`((* ... *))` for blocks, `((( ... )))` for variables) so your `{`, `}` and
`\` don't fight each other.

## Cost

**With Ollama:** free — all inference runs locally.

**With Groq:** free on the free tier for this workload — a daily digest of
a few dozen articles stays well within the free requests/tokens-per-day
limits. Check [console.groq.com/settings/limits](https://console.groq.com/settings/limits)
for your account's current caps.

**With Anthropic (Claude Haiku 4.5, default):** roughly per ingest cycle
with ~50 articles:

- Summarize: 6 batched calls (~8 articles each)
- Rewrite: 6 batched calls
- World-news compress: 1 call

Order-of-magnitude: a few cents to a few tens of cents per cycle depending on
article lengths. At 6 cycles/day that's well under $1/day. Going to Sonnet or
Opus multiplies the bill ~10–30×.

Set a spend cap at
https://console.anthropic.com/settings/billing → Spend limits — the run-loop
can't surprise you above whatever you set.

## Privacy

- All data lives on your machine (`./data/state.db` + `./data/archive/cache/`).
- With `LLM_BACKEND=anthropic`: article text is sent to the Anthropic API
  for summarization and rewriting. That's the only outbound destination for
  content (besides fetching the feeds themselves).
- With `LLM_BACKEND=groq`: article text is sent to the Groq API instead.
  Same shape as the Anthropic case — same only outbound destination for
  content.
- With `LLM_BACKEND=ollama`: nothing leaves your machine. All inference
  runs locally.
- No analytics, no telemetry, no third-party scripts in the landing page.
